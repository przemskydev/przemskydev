### Hi there 👋

Nowadays, in these difficult times (:crown:	🦠), my goal is to find a job that gives me the opportunity to improve my programming skills.👍

I am currently learning and working on a NodeJS with express.js framework.

In my projects, I use different kinds of libraries or tools adding new functionality or simplicity.

I am constantly learning new solutions, technologies, libraries, tools using various sources of knowledge. 😊 It is a never ending learning and I like it. 🤯

Hope you will enjoy your time here. 🤗

Best regards. 🤙
