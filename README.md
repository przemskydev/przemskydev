### Hi there 👋

Nowadays, in these difficult times (:crown:	🦠), my goal is to find a job that gives me the opportunity to improve my programming skills.👍

First of all, I am focused on JavaScript. My efforts are based on writing clear and semantically correct code. 🤓

I am currently learning and working on a better React syntax, using the most recent implementations such as hooks and design patterns, e.g. HOC, RenderProps, compound components, code modularization, logic extraction, etc.

In my projects (better or worse code quality 🤫😒), I use different kinds of libraries or tools (sometimes with tears in my eyes 😥) adding new functionality or simplicity.

I am constantly learning new solutions, technologies, libraries, tools using various sources of knowledge. 😊 It is a never ending learning and I like it. 🤯

Hope you will enjoy your time here. 🤗

Best regards. 🤙
